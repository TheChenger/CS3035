For this program I used object oriented python to create a class to represent a 3D vector.

**vector.py**

In this file I overloaded the following methods __str__(), __repr__(), ==, +, +=, -, -=, \*\, \*\=, %, []. 
Along with overloading those methods I added the magnitude method which took no parameters and returned the magnitude of the vector.

**vector_tester.py**

This file demonstrates all the aspects of my vector class
