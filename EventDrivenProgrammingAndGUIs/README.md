This program is made to show event driven programming using basic GUI's. 

In this program I was tasked with creating a credit card validator. Each of the major card holders start their cards with different digits and after those digits they all follow the same pattern to determine if the card number is valid.

Once the user inputs a card number several processes happen, it goes through to check which card holder.

Then algorithm to check if the card number is valid is applied, with the result showing up as an alert "valid" or "not valid"
