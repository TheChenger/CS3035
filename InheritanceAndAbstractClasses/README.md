In this program I demonstrate the use of inheritance and abstract classes. 

This is shown by creating an abstract 3Dshape class that the further classes will inherit.

The Cylinder and Pyramid Classes inherit from the shape3D class.

The ShapeList Class is used to maintain a list of the Shape3D objects. There are also instance methods that are added in this class that will be tested in the main module.

The main module asks the user how many of each, cylinder and pyramids, they would like created. This is also where the methods that were created in ShapeList are being tested. A color for the shape is also randomly chosen from a list of 20 colors. The generated pyramids and cylinders have random data for their data fields.
