In this program I created a histogram that calculated the frequency that words appear in a text document. The histogram is computed in two different ways and the times of each methods are recorded and displayed.
The first method is utilizing a list of Tuples and the second will utilize a Dictionary.

File I/O is used in this program as well.

The text_processing file is used to parse the text file and return a list of formatted data. Punctuation is removed in this file to make computing the words easier and the list cleaner.
