In this program I was required to use the functional programming paradigm. Recursion is also required as loops are not allowed.

There are 3 functions in this program, add(x,y), mult(x,y), and process_digits(n,operation)

The main method in this program asks the user to enter a number and then show the sum and product of the digits of that number.

In this program I was required to make each of the statements return true by using the functions: map(), filter(), or reduce().

The first problem required me to finish the my_range function so that it would return a list of values generated by taking the unput list L and only including values from L that are between start and end inclusive.

The second problem required me to implement the function one_dim_list to transform the given two-dimensional list into a one-dimensional list where the values appear in the same order. The function needed to return the resulting list.

The third problem required me to implement the multi_sum method to find the sum of each "row" of the 2D list given as a parameter. Each sum was required to be in a list of the sums. 

The fourth problem required me to implement the my_min funciton so that it would return the second smallest value in the input list L. If the list contained duplicated.
