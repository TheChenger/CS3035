In this program I was required to use the functional programming paradigm. Recursion is also required as loops are not allowed.

There are 3 functions in this program, add(x,y), mult(x,y), and process_digits(n,operation)

The main method in this program asks the user to enter a number and then show the sum and product of the digits of that number.
